# AWS Cost and Usage for Telegraf

This repository contains scripts extracting Amazon Web Services Cost and Usage data
to be feeded into Telegraf

## Reports overview

The AWS Cost and Usage reports can be managed from the
[Amazon console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/reports)  
All reports are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket.  
Each individual report contains the full data for the current billing month at the time of generation.  
The structure of the bucket folders and files, and the format of the CSV files are defined in the
[Amazon docs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/billing-reports.html#enhanced-organization)

Extra notes:
- Amazon seem to create a new report twice per day
- At the end of a month, the final days' data is missing from the report.  
They seem to be added after ~5 days in the following month.

## Restrictions
The scripts do NOT download reports from Amazon S3 but expect them to be available locally,
for example through [s3fs](https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse)

Reports are expected to use GZIP compression

## Usage
```
./extract_report.php -c CONFIG_FILE [-m TARGET_MONTH]

Required option:
    -c   CONFIG_FILE    define the config file to load
                        must contain all variables as in the config_example.php

Optional option:
    -m   TARGET_MONTH   define the report month to extract
                        value can be either 'current' or 'previous'
                        default value is 'current'
```

## Recommended setup
Given the way the reports are generated by Amazon, it is recommended to feed the data to Telegraf
through the [tail input plugin](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/tail)
and 2 cronjobs.  
One twice daily import for the current billing month.  
One monthly import for the previous billing month (to fix the last few days).

Telegraf tail input config
```
[[inputs.tail]]
  files = [ "/var/tmp/aws_cost_usage.out" ]
  data_format = "influx"
```

Cronjobs config
```
0 7,19 * * * extract_report.php -c myconfig.php -m current > /var/tmp/aws_cost_usage.out 2>> /var/log/aws_cost_usage.log
0 3 7 * * extract_report.php -c myconfig.php -m previous > /var/tmp/aws_cost_usage.out 2>> /var/log/aws_cost_usage.log
```
